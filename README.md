# FastCode

An IDE I built for an advanced programming class where we go in depth about how compilers work. This project starts with asking the user to create a class and its variables, methods/functions, logic controls (if statements), expressions (assignment statements), etc.

The class is an extension of Automata Theory where it touches on NLP (Natural Language Processing), CFL (Context-Free Languages) and Regular Expressions.
